ShapeShareVR allow users to have two different experiences, Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality. In the VR experience, users can generate different types of shape with different types of color and have them appeared in the VR space as well in the AR space. In the AR experience, the user can have the shape to appear as a superimposes image on top a user's webcam or have them appear on top of a marker.
